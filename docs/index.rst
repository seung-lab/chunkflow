3D image dataset could be too large to be processed in a single computer, and distributed processing was required. In most cases, the image dataset could be choped to chunks and distributed to computers for processing. This package provide a framework to perform distributed chunk processing.

For a brief introduction to the library, please read the :ref:`tutorial <tutorial>`. Visit the :ref:`installation page <installing>` page to see how to download the package. You can browse the :ref:`example gallery <example_gallery>` and :ref:`API reference <api>` to see what you can do with chunkflow.
