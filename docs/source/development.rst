Documentation
***************
We use `Sphinx`_ with `reStructuredText`_ to make documentation. You can make it locally for tests::

   cd docs
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   make html

.. _Sphinx: https://www.sphinx-doc.org
.. _reStructuredText: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html

You can also make other formats, such as pdf and epub. Checkout it out with `make help`.

Add a New Operator
*******************
#. Take a look of the existing simple operators, such as :file:`chunkflow/flow/operators/create_chunk.py`.

#. Create your own operator file in the `operators` folder.

#. Create your own operator class such as `MyOperator`, and this class should inherit from the `.base.OperatorBase`.

#. Define the job of you operator in `__call__(self, chunk, *other_args, **kwargs)`.

#. add the import operator code in :file:`chunkflow/flow/operators/__init__.py`.

#. Add unit test in :file:`tests/flow/operators/`. 

#. Run your unit test by :code:`pytest tests/flow/operators/my_operator.py`
   
#. Add documentation in :ref:`api`.
