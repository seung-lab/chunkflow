Chunk operations for large scale 3D image dataset processing

# Introduction
3D image dataset could be too large to be processed in a single computer, and distributed processing was required. In most cases, the image dataset could be choped to chunks and distributed to computers for processing. This package provide a framework to perform distributed chunk processing. 

## Features
- Decoupled frontend and backend. The computational heavy backend could be any computer with internet connection and Amazon Web Services (AWS) authentication. 
- Composable Commandline interface. The chunk operators could be freely composed in commandline for flexible usage. This is also super useful for tests and experiments.

# Usage

## Installation
This package was registered in PyPi, just run a simple command to install:
```
pip install chunkflow
```

or download and install manually:
```
pip install .
```
Note that do not install using `python setup.py install` since some packages are not installable using it.

## Run unittest
```
python -m unittest
```

## Get Help
`chunkflow --help`

get help for commands: `chunkflow command --help`

## Examples
The commands could be composed and used flexiblly. The first command should be a generator though.
```
chunkflow create-chunk view
chunkflow create-chunk 
```
A Typical pipeline to run ConvNet inference is something like:
```
chunkflow --verbose fetch-task --queue-name="$QUEUE_NAME" --visibility-timeout=$VISIBILITY_TIMEOUT cutout --volume-path="$IMAGE_LAYER_PATH" --expand-margin-size 4 64 64 inference --convnet-model=your-model-name --convnet-weight-path=path/of/net/weight --patch-size 20 256 256 --patch-overlap 4 64 64 --output-key your-output-key --framework='identity' --batch-size 2 crop-margin save --volume-path="$OUTPUT_LAYER_PATH" --upload-log --nproc 4 --create-thumbnail delete-task-in-queue
```

## Some Typical Operators
- [x] Convolutional Network Inference. Currently, we support [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) and [pznet](https://github.com/supersergiy/znnphi_interface)
- [x] Task Generator. Fetch task from AWS SQS.
- [x] Cutout service. Cutout chunk from datasets formatted as [neuroglancer precomputed](https://github.com/google/neuroglancer/tree/master/src/neuroglancer/datasource/precomputed) using [cloudvolume](https://github.com/seung-lab/cloud-volume)
- [x] Save. Save chunk to neuroglancer precomputed. 
- [x] Save Images. Save chunk as a serials of PNG images in local directory.
- [x] Real File. Read image from hdf5 and tiff files. 
- [x] View. View chunk using cloudvolume viewer.
- [x] Mask. Mask out the chunk using a precomputed dataset.
- [x] Cloud Watch. Realtime speedometer using AWS CloudWatch.

### Use specific GPU device
We can simply set an environment variable to use specific GPU device.

`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2 chunkflow`

## Produce tasks to AWS SQS queue
in `bin`, 

`python produce_tasks.py --help`

## Terminology
- patch: ndarray as input to ConvNet. Normally it is pretty small due to the limited memory capacity of GPU.
- chunk: ndarray with global offset and arbitrary shape.
- block: the array with a shape and global offset aligned with storage backend. The block could be saved directly to storage backend. The alignment with storage files ensures that there is no writting conflict when saved parallelly.

# Development
## Create a new release in PyPi 
```
python setup.py sdist
twine upload dist/chunkflow-version.tar.gz
```

## Add a new operator
To be added.
